- Firstly, moving on with the story will always be triggered by the 'continue' or 'next' key words.\n
^ Not to be confused with the 'Next Page' button on the bottom right of your screen.\n
^I'll let you know when to press that, otherwise don't touch! (Type anything to continue...)

- Secondly, as the purpose of this adventure is roleplay, the input field will also act as your in character dialouge.\n
^ Some responses will be guided by tigger words but others will be all your own.\n 
^I will alway provide trigger words if the first is the case otherwise let your mind be your guide. (Let's see if you understood what I meant...)

- Lastly as this is only a demo the character route and story has already been chosen for you.\n
